SO:0000590	SRP_RNA	"The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein. It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72	 68	 54	 19	 14	 and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria	 the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures	 with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains	 separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure	 with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis)	 however	 have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea	 the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding."	"SO:0000655	SO:0000589"

SO:0000603	group_II_intron	"Group II introns are found in rRNA	 tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi	 plants and protists	 and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site	 followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo	 and long range intron to intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus	 distance of bulged A from 3' splice site	 some tertiary interactions	 and intronic ORF phylogeny."
